The pre and post-padframe irsim test uses the same test cases, and the only changes are the I/O names. 

The first test case is a seed input of 7. The LFSR produces a sequence of 15, 14, 13, 10, 5, 11, and 6. Player 1 is dealt a 10 of hearts, a 9 of hearts, 3 of Spades, and the obligatory 3 of clubs. Meanwhile, the computer is given 8 of diamonds, 6 of diamonds, Q of diamonds, and 7 of hearts. Player 1 opens with their 3 of clubs, answered by a 7 of hearts. Player 1 then slaps back with a 3 of Spades, leading the computer to forfeit the round. The player then puts down their 10 of hearts, which is larger than any cards the computer has. With just one card left after the computer has conceded again, Player 1 wins. 

The second test case is a seed input of 8. We know that a sequence of 1, 3, 7, 15, 14, 13, and 10 are generated from a seed value of 8. As a result, the player is given 10 of diamonds, 7 of hearts, 6 of clubs, and 3 of clubs. The computer player is given a 9 of hearts, 3 of spades, 10 of clubs, and 8 of diamonds. In our simulation, weâ€™ve commanded player one to first place down their 3 of clubs cards. Then, the computer would respond with 8 of diamonds, causing player one to answer with their next highest card, 7 of hearts. Player two goes for their 3 of spades, after which the first player attempts to put down 6 of clubs, but fails because it is smaller than 3 of spades. The first player forfeits its turn, allowing player two to use 10 of clubs and 9 of hearts to win.
