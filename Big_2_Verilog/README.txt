The four Verilog files that are being implemented on the final cell design are Project_Card (for card generation), Project_DP, Project_FSM, and Project_Top. Note that Project_Card_edge_null.v contains a fix for one of the edge cases, but it is not implemented on the final cell design since the change was made really late in the project. There are also four Top_tb Verilog files as testbenches. The synthesis and encounter scripts are all in the SynthesisEncounter folder.
